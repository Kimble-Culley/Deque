Deque Toolkit

Overview
  In this project, CRTLZ (Kimble and Sydney) built a deque! Our deque was created using a dynamic double array. 

Design Decisions 
    We implemented dynamic memory managment to store the data of the deque. We used dynamically allocated blocks 
    to allow the deque to dynamically grow and shrink as needed. 

Properly Working
  Push back
  Pop front 
  Popback

Challenges/Bugs
  No Push front   

  How to Run the Program 
    The testing of the deque is automated. Compilation and execution is all that is needed. 

Partner Collaboration 
  We worked on this project very simular to the previous partner assignments. We meet up in the computer lab on 
  multiple occasions. While in there, one of us would code, while the other did research, help debug, and assist in 
  any way needed. We would switch roles every so often.
